# Scratch Thanos's Adventures
This is NOT made in scratch, but in java. it is based on a scratch game.
In this funny video game, Scratch Thanos is on a quest to find all 6 infinity stones so he can snap half the universe into corn flakes. I won't give much more spoilers than that ;)

This game is based on a scratch project made by TheKingOfDucks (Spoilers): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/290555853/

There was also a high-res video based on that scratch project.

## Building
It isnt really done yet, but you can build it at whatever state its at and check it out.
The entire thing is java. Just make sure you have the resources in the correct folders.

## Committing
I would love to have collaberation on this, although it would likely take someone with a similar sense of humor. Feel free to send me an email. othello71@outlook.com
